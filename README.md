# F1004B
This is the final project from Tec de Monterrey's F1004B course: Computational Modeling of Movement. In this project we had to model the movement of a rover using a differential equation that was solved numerically using MATLAB.
This course was imparted in Spanish and therefore all comments in the source code and the report were written in Spanish.
