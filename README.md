# F1004B 💻
This is the final project from Tec de Monterrey's F1004B course: Computational Modeling of Movement. In this project we had to model the movement of a rover using a differential equation that was solved numerically using MATLAB.

This course was imparted in Spanish and therefore all comments in the source code and the report were written in Spanish. Moreover, I'm not the only contributor to the project, the names of all the other contributors can be found in the report coverpage.
